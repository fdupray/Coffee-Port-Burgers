# Coffee-Port-Burgers
iOS development test.

- Kingfisher, Reachability and Gloss were installed with cocoapods. 
     
- No unit tests. Writing tests would've increased development time.
     
- App can be used horizontally too.
     
- This table view controller is embedded in a navigation controller in storyboard. Although it isn't needed in this test, it makes for better design and presentation (status bar and table view conflict)
    
- Hard coded values have been done so consciously (referring to Color Literals in cellForRow func mainly).
